				<a href="#">Crochet</a>
				<p>Crochet is a needlework technique performed using a crochet
					hook plus fiber or other similar material. Most typically, this
					material is yarn or crochet thread, but it might also be fabric,
					wire, twine, or other innovative material.</p>
					<p><u>The Goals in Crochet:</u> The most popular goal in crochet is
					obvious: Crochet enthusiasts hope to complete crochet projects,
					which are typically objects that are useful, attractive or
					beneficial in some way. Popular projects include afghans, baby
					blankets, baby booties, scarves, hats, granny squares, shawls,
					purses, tote bags and others. It's possible to crochet a variety of
					different things, including jewelry, socks, and curtains.</p>

				<a href="#">Clay Design</a>
				<p>Polymer clay is a modeling material that cures when heated from 265 °F (129 °C) to 275 °F (135 °C) for 15 minutes per 1⁄4 inch (6.4 mm) of thickness, and does not significantly shrink or change shape during the process. Despite being called "clay", it generally contains no clay minerals. Polymer clay is sold in craft, hobby and art stores, and is used by artists, hobbyists, and children. Polymer clay is also popular in animation since it allows static forms to be manipulated frame after frame. Leading brands of polymer clay include Fimo, Kato Polyclay, Sculpey, & Modello.</p>

					Beadwork techniques are broadly divided into loom and off-loom weaving, stringing, bead embroidery, bead crochet, and bead knitting.
						Most cultures have employed beads for personal adornment. Archaeological records show that people made and used beads as long as 5,000 years ago. Beads have also been used for religious purposes, as good luck talismans, and as curative agents.</p>
